# Slack MCP Server - Comprehensive Implementation

This Slack MCP (Model Context Protocol) server now provides comprehensive file operations and reaction management functionality, completing the "slack api„Åß„Åß„Åç„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÅØ‰∏ÄÈÄö„ÇäÂÆüË£Ö" requirement.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### MCP Client Configuration

This server can be used with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, VSCode, etc.).

#### Using with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["slack-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using with local installation

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/slack-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slack-mcp-server.git
cd slack-mcp-server
./setup.sh

# Build and run
npm run build
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

The server supports the following environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | ‚úÖ Yes | - | Bot token (xoxb-*) from your Slack App |
| `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` | ‚ùå No | - | User token (xoxp-*) for extended functionality |
| `USE_USER_TOKEN_FOR_READ` | ‚ùå No | `false` | Use user token for read operations |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | ‚ùå No | `info` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |

### Token Usage Strategy

By default (security-first approach):
- **All operations use bot token** (requires proper bot scopes)
- Search operations will return helpful error messages

For extended functionality:
- Set `USE_USER_TOKEN_FOR_READ=true` to enable:
  - Message and file search capabilities
  - Access to channels bot hasn't joined
  - Broader workspace visibility

Example configurations:

#### Bot Token Only (Default - Most Secure)
```json
{
  "env": {
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token"
  }
}
```

#### With User Token for Extended Features
```json
{
  "env": {
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
    "SLACK_USER_TOKEN": "xoxp-your-user-token",
    "USE_USER_TOKEN_FOR_READ": "true"
  }
}
```

### Required Bot Token Scopes

For bot-only mode, ensure your Slack App has these OAuth scopes:
- `channels:read` - Read channel information
- `channels:history` - Read channel messages
- `groups:read` - Read private channels
- `groups:history` - Read private channel messages
- `users:read` - Read user information
- `team:read` - Read workspace information
- `files:read` - Read file information
- `files:write` - Upload and manage files
- `chat:write` - Send messages
